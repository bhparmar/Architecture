It worked by having two Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), the first called an encoder and the second called a decoder. The first RNN encodes the source-text as a single vector of numbers and the second RNN decodes this vector into the destination-text. The intermediate vector between the encoder and decoder is a kind of summary of the source-text, which is sometimes called a \"thought-vector\". The reason for using this intermediate summary-vector is to understand the whole source-text before it is being translated. This also allows for the source- and destination-texts to have different lengths.\n","\n","In this tutorial we will replace the encoder with an image-recognition model similar to Transfer Learning and Fine-Tuning in Tutorials #08 and #10. The image-model recognizes what the image contains and outputs that as a vector of numbers - the \"thought-vector\" or summary-vector, which is then input to a Recurrent Neural Network that decodes this vector into text.\n","\n","This is a somewhat advanced tutorial and you should be familiar with TensorFlow, Keras, Transfer Learning and Natural Language Processing, see Tutorials #01, #03-C, #08, #10, #20, and #21."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"oqMttLgkqjAF"},"source":["## Flowchart\n","\n","We will use the VGG16 model that has been pre-trained for classifying images. But instead of using the last classification layer, we will redirect the output of the previous layer. This gives us a vector with 4096 elements that summarizes the image-contents - similar to how a \"thought-vector\" summarized the contents of an input-text in Tutorial #21 on language translation. We will use this vector as the initial state of the Gated Recurrent Units (GRU). However, the internal state-size of the GRU is only 512, so we need an intermediate fully-connected (dense) layer to map the vector with 4096 elements down to a vector with only 512 elements.\n","\n","The decoder then uses this initial-state together with a start-marker \"ssss\" to begin producing output words. In the first iteration it will hopefully output the word \"big\". Then we input this word into the decoder and hopefully we get the word \"brown\" out, and so on. Finally we have generated the text \"big brown bear sitting eeee\" where \"eeee\" marks the end of the text.\n","\n","The flowchart of the algorithm is

If it sees an image of a giraffe and correctly produces a caption stating that, it doesn't mean that the model has a deep understanding of what a giraffe is; the model doesn't know that it's a tall animal that lives in Africa and Zoos.\n","\n","The model is merely a clever way of mapping pixels in an image to a vector of floating-point numbers that summarize the contents of the image, and then map these numbers to a sequence of integers-tokens representing words. So the model is basically just a very advanced function approximator rather than human-like intelligence."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"9EpQ2W_SqjDZ"},"source":["## Exercises\n","\n","These are a few suggestions for exercises that may help improve your skills with TensorFlow.

Does it improve the quality of the generated captions?\n","* Try another architecture for the Recurrent Neural Network, e.g. change the number of GRU layers, their internal state-size, the embedding-size, etc. Can you improve the quality of the generated captions?\n","* Use another transfer-layer from the VGG16-model, for example the flattened output of the last convolutional layer.\n","* Try adding more dense-layers to the mapping between the transfer-values and the initial-state in the decoder.\n","* When generating captions, instead of using `np.argmax()` to sample the next integer-token, could you sample the decoder's output as if it was a probability distribution instead? Note that the decoder's output is not softmax-limited so you have to do that first to turn it into a probability-distribution.\n","* Can you generate multiple sequences by doing this sampling? Can you find a way to select the best of these different sequences?\n","* Connect the image-model directly to the decoder so you can fine-tune the weights of the image-model. See Tutorial #10 on Fine-Tuning.\n","* Can you train a Machine Translation model from Tutorial #21 and then connect its decoder to a pre-trained image-model to make an image captioning model? Perhaps you need an intermediate fully-connected layer that you will train.\n","* Can you measure the quality of the generated captions using some mathematical formula?\n","* Modify the decoder so it also returns the states of the GRU-units. Then change `generate_caption()` so it only inputs and outputs one integer-token in each iteration. You need to get the GRU-states out of `decoder_model.predict()` and feed them back in next time you call it. Now you compute less in each iteration, but there is still a lot of overhead, so it may not be much faster when using a GPU?\n","* Explain to a friend how the program works."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"l_XP5HmoqjDZ"},"source":["## License (MIT)\n","\n","Copyright (c) 2018 by [Magnus Erik Hvass Pedersen](http://www.hvass-labs.org/)\n","\n","Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n","\n","The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n","\n","THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
